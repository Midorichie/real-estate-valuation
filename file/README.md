# On-Chain Real Estate Valuation Tool

A blockchain-based smart contract system for real-time property valuation on the Stacks blockchain.

## Project Overview

This project implements a decentralized real estate valuation system using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. The system allows property owners to register their properties, update valuations, record sales, and transfer ownership while maintaining a transparent history of valuations.

### Key Features

- Property registration with essential metrics (location, size, bedrooms, etc.)
- Real-time property valuation based on blockchain data
- Valuation history tracking
- Property sale recording
- Ownership transfer functionality
- Modular and extensible design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) - Clarity development environment
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - For running tests
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - For version control

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-valuation.git
   cd real-estate-valuation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run Clarinet console:
   ```bash
   clarinet console
   ```

## Smart Contract Architecture

The project consists of four main smart contracts:

1. **real-estate-valuation.clar**: Main entry point for the application
2. **property-registry.clar**: Handles property registration and ownership
3. **valuation-engine.clar**: Implements valuation algorithms and calculations
4. **utils.clar**: Provides utility functions for the other contracts

## Key Functions

### Property Management

- `register-property`: Register a new property with initial details
- `transfer-property`: Transfer ownership of a property to a new owner
- `get-property-details`: Retrieve detailed information about a property

### Valuation

- `update-property-valuation`: Update the valuation of a property
- `get-property-valuation`: Get the current valuation of a property
- `get-property-valuation-history`: Get the valuation history of a property

### Sales

- `record-property-sale`: Record the sale of a property with sale price

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests for all smart contract functions. To run the tests:

```bash
clarinet test
```

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Initial Development Framework (Current)
- Set up project structure
- Implement basic property registration and valuation
- Create test suite

### Phase 2: Advanced Valuation Logic
- Implement market-based valuation algorithms
- Add comparables functionality
- Integrate with external data sources

### Phase 3: User Interface and Integration
- Develop web interface
- Add API endpoints
- Integrate with third-party services
